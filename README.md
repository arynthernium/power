# power

A game about generating electricity. Starting with basic dynamo arrays and building up to fusion power, this is a game about the progression of electricity in an RTS style.

Roadmap:
- [ ] Implement game map (2d array, html table?)
- [ ] Render graphics on a grid (using placeholders)
- [ ] Create game stages (dynamos to fusion)
- [ ] Create research system to throttle gameplay
- [ ] Create numeric systems (money, electricity)
- [ ] Implement random terrain generation (resources)
- [ ] Create city system (population, energy demand)
